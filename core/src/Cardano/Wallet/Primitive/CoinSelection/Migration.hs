-- This module contains an algorithm to select coins for migration from legacy
-- wallets to newer wallets.
--
-- We want users to be able to migrate their funds from a legacy random wallet
-- to a new sequential wallet. To do this, we have to move funds from a wallet
-- to another by making transactions. Funds are ultimately a sum of many coins
-- (a.k.a UTxOs). In a transaction, we can select a few coins, and send them to
-- addresses, effectively creating new coins / UTxOs doing this.
--
-- There are some limitations regarding the number of coins that can be selected
-- at once in a single transaction (theoretically 255 coins, in practice ~170)
-- because there's a transaction max size (in bytes) enforced by the network.
-- Also, there's a direct relationship between the maximum number of inputs we
-- can select, and the maximum number of outputs we can produce (increasing one
-- will decrease the other, and vice-versa).
--
-- When making a transaction, coins used as inputs for a transaction becomes
-- unavailable for a while, until the transaction is inserted into the ledger
-- and, make some new coins available as change (very much like when paying
-- with bank notes to a shop, if we give a 20 EUR note to pay for 3 EUR, we
-- can't spend the remaining 17 EUR before we have received the change!).
-- So, a wallet with a small number of UTxO will not be able to make many
-- transactions in parallel and will have to make them sequentially, waiting
-- for the previous ones to be inserted before making new ones (we also say
-- that a wallet is not "fragmented enough").
