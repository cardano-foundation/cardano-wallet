# Reminder on GHC RTS options:
#   -N ⟨x⟩
#         Use ⟨x⟩ simultaneous threads when running the program.
#   -qg ⟨gen⟩
#         Use parallel GC in generation ⟨gen⟩ and higher.
#         Omitting ⟨gen⟩ turns off the parallel GC completely,
#         reverting to sequential GC.
#   -A    allocation area size used by the garbage collector
#   -I0   disables the idle GC.
#   -T    produce runtime-system statistics, such as
#         the amount of time spent executing the program
#         and in the garbage collector.
#         -T collects the data, but produces no output.
#   -M ⟨size⟩
#         Set the maximum heap size to ⟨size⟩ bytes.
#   -h    Generates a basic heap profile, in the file prog.hp.
