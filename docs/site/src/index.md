# Cardano Wallet

Cardano Wallet helps you manage your Ada. You can use it to send and receive payments on the [Cardano][] blockchain.

This project provides an HTTP Application Programming Interface (API) and command-line interface (CLI) for working with your wallet.

It can be used as a component of a frontend such as [Daedalus][], which provides a friendly user interface for wallets. Most users who would like to use Cardano should start with Daedalus.
