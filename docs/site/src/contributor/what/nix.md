# Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a package manager and build tool. It is used in `cardano-wallet` for:
 - Provisioning dependencies in [Buildkite CI](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/.buildkite).
 - Reproducible development environments ([nix develop][flake.nix]).

Nix is required for `cardano-wallet`
    - development
    - building of executables
    - building of the docker image

## Installing/Upgrading Nix

The minimum required version of Nix is 2.5.

## Binary cache

To improve build speed, it is **highly recommended** (but not mandatory) to configure the **binary cache maintained by IOG**.

See [iohk-nix/docs/nix.md](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/blob/8b1d65ba294708b12d7b15103ac35431d9b60819/docs/nix.md) or [cardano-node/doc/getting-started/building-the-node-using-nix.md](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/blob/468f52e5a6a2f18a2a89218a849d702481819f0b/doc/getting-started/building-the-node-using-nix.md#building-under-nix)
for instructions on how to configure the IOG binary cache on your system.

## Building with Nix

See the
[Building](../developer-guide/building.md#nix)
page.

## Reproducible Development Environment

Run [`nix develop`][nix-develop] to get a build environment which includes all
necessary compilers, libraries, and development tools.

This uses the `devShell` attribute of [`flake.nix`][flake.nix].

Full instructions are on the [Building](../developer-guide/building.md#nix)
page.

## Development tips

### Code generation

The Nix build depends on code which is generated from
the Cabal files. If you change these files, then you will probably
need to update the generated files.

To do this, run:

```
./nix/regenerate.sh
```

Then add and commit the files that it creates.

Alternatively, wait for Buildkite to run this same command. It will
produce a patch, and also push a commit with updates back to your
branch.

### Haskell.nix pin

The Nix build also depends on the [Haskell.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix) build infrastructure.
It may be necessary to update `haskell.nix` when moving to a
new Haskell LTS version or adding Hackage dependencies.

To update to the latest version, run the following command:

```console
$ nix flake lock --update-input haskellNix
warning: updating lock file '/home/rodney/iohk/cw/flake/flake.lock':
• Updated input 'haskellNix':
    'github:input-output-hk/haskell.nix/f05b4ce7337cfa833a377a4f7a889cdbc6581103' (2022-01-11)

• Updated input 'haskellNix/hackage':

• Updated input 'haskellNix/stackage':
    'github:input-output-hk/stackage.nix/308844000fafade0754e8c6641d0277768050413' (2022-01-11)

warning: Git tree '/home/rodney/iohk/cw/flake' is dirty
```

Then commit the updated
[flake.lock](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/flake.lock)
file.

When updating Haskell.nix, consult the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/blob/master/changelog.md#L1) file. There may have been API changes which need corresponding updates in `cardano-wallet`.

### iohk-nix pin

The procedure for updating the [`iohk-nix`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix) library of common code is much the same as for Haskell.nix. Run this command and commit the updated `flake.lock` file:

```console
$ nix flake lock --update-input iohkNix
```

It is not often necessary to update `iohk-nix`. Before updating, ask devops whether there may be changes which affect our build.

## Common problems

### Warning: dumping very large path

```
warning: dumping very large path (> 256 MiB); this may run out of memory
```

Make sure you don't have large files or directories in your git worktree.

When building, Nix will copy the project sources into
`/nix/store`. Generated folders such as `dist-newstyle` will be filtered
out, but everything else will be copied.
