## **Why**

The sudden decommission of Hydra forces us to revisit our Continuous Integration (CI) setup.

## **Decision**

We predominantly rely on [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com) as CI system.

We build **artifacts** and run **checks** on them. Artifacts include compiled executables, but also the source code itself. Checks include unit and integration tests, but also source code linters. We specify our artifacts in \`flake.nix\`, and most of our checks, too.

We perform these builds and checks with different **granularity** â€” in order to keep our computing resources within reasonable limits, we donâ€™t automatically check everything on every commit. Instead, the granularities are:

* `post-commit`	\= (at most once) after each commit; for a quick sanity check after a push
* `pre-merge`	\= before merging each pull request; for a reasonably complete, automated check that master will satisfy functional requirements
* `post-merge`	\= after merging each pull request to master; for an exhaustive check that master satisfies functional requirements on all platforms
* `nightly`		\= every night; for an exhaustive, automated check of functional and non-functional requirements

The following **table** lists our artifacts, the checks performed on them (\`.\` for build), the granularity at which the check is performed, and the CI system used for doing that:
