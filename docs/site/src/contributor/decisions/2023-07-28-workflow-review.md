## **Why**

As we have now moved to the Cardano Foundation, it’s an appropriate time to review how we operate as a team and see what improvements we can implement.

## **Decision**

1. Due to the distributed nature of the team, where possible and practical we will continue to favor asynchronous working.
2. We will adopt a Kanban-esque approach to managing our workflow, therefore:
   1. Work items will be continuously prioritized in line with agreed goals and roadmap.
   2. Weekly planning & replenishment meetings will be held.
   3. We will no longer plan work into sprints or iterations.
   4. Updated meetings and ceremonies:

| Meeting / Activity            | Frequency             | How                                                                         |
|:------------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Updates                 | Daily / as applicable | Provided in slack \#hal-daily                                               |
| Planning & Replenishment      | Weekly                | Friday meeting  (½ hr)                                                      |
| Development Meeting           | Weekly                | Wednesday (1hr)                                                             |
| Backlog Refinement & Grooming | Continuously          | Asynchronously, supported by breakout sessions and ad hoc team meetings.    |
| Demos                         | Ad hoc                | Scheduled upon feature completion. Will demo as part of a feature showcase. |
| Retro                         | Quarterly / ad hoc    | Deep Dive meeting (3 hrs)                                                   |

3. To determine how best to implement an internal team “No Meeting Day”, this will be progressed via its own advice process.
4. Public team channel (\#hal-public) created to facilitate communications and collaboration within the Cardano Foundation and IOG.
5. Current ticketing system JIRA will continue to be used, subject to future Advice Process.
6. Cardano Wallet [public forum on Github](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/discussions) to be utilized for engaging with the community and for also announcing new releases.
