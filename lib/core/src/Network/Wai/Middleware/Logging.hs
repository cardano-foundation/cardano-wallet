  We can't actually read the content of a request twice, which has several
  issues.

  First of all, the 'setLogger' method from the 'warp' package isn't really
  helpful as we get a `Request` object in argument, but can't extract its body
  since it has already been consumed by the time it reaches our logger. As a
  consequence, we can merely do logging on superficial request information
  (e.g. headers, status, path etc.).

  See: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp-3.2.27/docs/Network-Wai-Handler-Warp.html#v:setLogger

  Then, there exists packages like `wai-extra` with ways to construct detailed
  loggers from a 'Request' object and its body parsed via some ad-hoc helpers
  (see below). However, this package requires a few undesirable dependencies
  (like data-default, or wai-logger) but more importantly, it doesn't make it
  possible to use a custom trace or logger object but instead, forces log outputs
  and behaviors to what's supported by the package.

  See: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-extra-3.0.26/docs/Network-Wai-Middleware-RequestLogger.html

  So, in order to implement our own Request/Response logging middleware, I've
  extracted some relevant bits from the `wai-extra` package in order to:

  - Read the request body, and put it back. There's a small performance cost in
    doing so of course, but that's rather fine for the wallet API which isn't
    meant to serve concurrent client and be under heavy load.

  - Extract the body from a response and make it available in an IORef.

  Source code from the original functions below can be found in 'wai-extra'

  See: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-extra-3.0.26/docs/src/Network.Wai.Middleware.RequestLogger.html

  (Note that functions have been slightly adjust for code-style and, to return
  an extra response status when available instead of only the request body).
