-- | This abstraction exists to give us the ability to keep the wallet business
-- logic agnostic to the address derivation and discovery mechanisms.
--
-- This is needed because two different address schemes lives on Cardano:
--
--   - A hierarchical random scheme:
--      rather 'custom' made, with several flaws; this is the original and now
--      legacy address scheme.
--
--   - A hierarchical sequential scheme:
--      a new scheme based on the BIP-0044 specification, which is better suited
--      for our present needs.
--
-- In practice, we will need a wallet that can support both, even if not at the
-- same time, and this little abstraction can buy us this without introducing
-- too much overhead.

-- | More powerful than 'isOurs', this abstractions offer the underlying state
-- the ability to find / compute the address private key corresponding to a
-- given known address.
--
-- Requiring 'IsOwned' as a constraint supposed that there is a way to recover
-- the root private key of a particular wallet. This isn't true for externally
-- owned wallet which would delegate its key management to a third party (like
-- a hardware Ledger or Trezor).

        -- operation; This is merely a lookup from known addresses.

-- | Abstracting over change address generation. In theory, this is only needed
