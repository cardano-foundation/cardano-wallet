    -- This mapping is supposed to be (practically) a one-way function:
    -- Given an 'addr', it is impossible to compute the preimage
    -- 'ix' in practice.
    -- The purpose of the 'Pool' data structure is to help inverting
    -- this function regardless. The idea is that addresses
    -- with small indices @0,1,…@ are 'Used' before addresses with larger
    -- indices; specifically, only less than 'gap' many addresses in sequence
    -- may be 'Unused' before the next 'Used' address.
    -- This usage scheme restricts the search space considerably
    -- and allows us to practically invert the 'addressFromIx' function.
