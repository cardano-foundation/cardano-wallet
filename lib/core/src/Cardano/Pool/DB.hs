-- | A Database interface for storing pool production in DB.
--
-- To use it, you will need the NamedFieldPuns extension and wrap operations
-- with @atomically@:
--
-- Example:
--
-- >>> :set -XNamedFieldPuns
-- >>> DBLayer{atomically,putPoolProduction} = db
-- >>> atomically $ putPoolProduction blockHeader pool
--
-- This gives you the power to also run /multiple/ operations atomically.
--
-- FIXME: Allowing 'MonadIO' to enable logging also within db transactions.
-- Ideally, we should lower than constraint to only allow logging effects and
-- not any dragons in IO.
