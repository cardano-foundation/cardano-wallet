-- | Checks whether or not a given entity belongs to us.
--
-- This abstraction exists to give us the ability to keep the wallet business
-- logic agnostic to the address derivation and discovery mechanisms.
--
-- This is needed because two different address schemes lives on Cardano:
--
--   - A hierarchical random scheme:
--      rather 'custom' made, with several flaws; this is the original and now
--      legacy address scheme.
--
--   - A hierarchical sequential scheme:
--      a new scheme based on the BIP-0044 specification, which is better suited
--      for our present needs.
--
-- In practice, we will need a wallet that can support both, even if not at the
-- same time, and this little abstraction can buy us this without introducing
-- too much overhead.

        :: entity
        -> s

-- | Abstracting over change address generation. In theory, this is only needed
-- for sending transactions on a wallet following a particular scheme. This
-- abstractions allows for defining an heuristic to pick new change address. For
-- instance, in BIP-44, change addresses belong to a particular change chain
-- (also called "Internal Chain").

        -- generating a new change address depends on the underlying scheme.

-- | Ordering addresses by discovery date.
--
-- If `a1` has been discovered before `a2`, then the following equation holds:
--
-- @
-- compareDiscovery s a1 a2 == LT
-- @
--
-- If `a1` has been discovered after `a2`, then the following equation holds:
--
-- @
-- compareDiscovery s a1 a2 == GT
-- @
--
-- Note that, if an address isn't known it is considered not discovered and
-- therefore, is always _greater than_ any known address.

--
-- NOTE: Change addresses aren't considered "known" until they've been used. The
-- rationale is that, we don't want users or consumers of the wallet to be using
-- change addresses prematurely.

-- | One master node (seed) can be used for unlimited number of independent
-- cryptocoins such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Namecoin. However, sharing the
-- same space for various cryptocoins has some disadvantages.
--
-- This level creates a separate subtree for every cryptocoin, avoiding reusing
-- addresses across cryptocoins and improving privacy issues.
--
-- Coin type is a constant, set for each cryptocoin. For Cardano this constant
-- is set to 1815' (or 0x80000717). 1815 is the birthyear of our beloved Ada
-- Lovelace.
