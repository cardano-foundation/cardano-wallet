-- The funds associated with an address are considered suitable for use as

--
-- So, there are a few properties we would like to assert about our
-- "addressSuitableForCollateral" function:
--
-- 1. That our classification function always considers addresses with a keyhash
--    payment credential as suitable for collateral.
-- 2. That our classification function always considers addresses without a
--    keyhash payment credential as unsuitable for collateral.
-- 3. That future format addresses are always rejected.
--
-- That's it really. We also want to assert that our generators cover the full
-- range of possible address types, including future and unknown formats. So we
-- start by creating a generator that customizes its frequency to ensure that
-- every type of address is evenly covered (i.e. "genByronAddr" only generates
-- one type of address so is given lower frequency than "genShelleyAddr", which
-- must generate eight types of addresses). We also include Addresses that are

-- Using real addresses for the generators is an important idea, as the domain
-- of the classification function is the set of all addresses (really all
-- ByteStrings, thanks to our loose representation of Addresses, but we also
-- account for that in our generator). However, real addresses make for awful
-- counterexamples, so after generating an address, we try to determine what
-- kind of address it is by inspecting the first four bits: If it is an address
-- format we recognize, we shrink towards an address that has the same first
-- four bits, but 0 bits everywhere else. This forms a valid address that is
-- easier on the eyes, except in two cases: stake addresses and bootstrap
-- addresses. We can offer no shrinkage for those two kinds of addresses, but
-- try to provide a good explanation using `counterExample`. This is a helpful
-- strategy because at this current point in time collateral suitability can be
-- determined simply by inspecting the first four bits, so that is the most
-- important piece of information for debugging.
--
-- Here is an example of test output without shrinking:
-- Address "p\r\148\225ts.\249\170\231?9Z\180E\a\191\169\131\214P#\193\SUB\149\US\f2\228\204u\NUL\SOH"
-- Address hex: 71d94e174732ef9aae73f395ab4457bfa983d65023c11a951fc32e4cc7501
-- AddressType: Just (EnterpriseAddress CredentialScriptHash)
--
-- And here is an example of test output with shrinking:
-- Address "p\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL"

-- We want to assert many of the same properties about "asCollateral" as we do
-- for "addressSuitableForCollateral". Rather than testing these properties
-- twice, we use the following logic:
--
--   - Given that the implementation of "addressSuitableForCollateral" is
--     correct,
--   - Given that the implementation of "TokenBundle.toCoin" is correct,
--   - and that "asCollateral" is equivalent to a simple composition of
--     "addressSuitableForCollateral" and "TokenBundle.toCoin",
--
-- We can say that the implementation of "asCollateral" is also correct, so
-- long as the composition operator is guaranteed not to change the properties
-- we are interested in. We can prove the equivalence like so:

-- | Assert that if the "composition" of "addressSuitableForCollateral" and
-- "TokenBundle.toCoin" returns, "asCollateral" should also return.
prop_equivalence_bool :: TxOut -> Property
prop_equivalence_bool txOut@(TxOut addr toks) =
    isJust (asCollateral txOut)
    ===
    (addressSuitableForCollateral addr && TokenBundle.isCoin toks)

-- | Assert that the "asCollateral" function is equivalent to the "composition"
-- of "addressSuitableForCollateral" and "TokenBundle.toCoin".
prop_equivalence :: TxOut -> Property
prop_equivalence txOut@(TxOut addr toks) =
    asCollateral txOut
    ===
    (guard (addressSuitableForCollateral addr) >> TokenBundle.toCoin toks)

-- The composition operator we are using here is the Maybe instance of (>>). The
-- guard lifts the Boolean to a Maybe, maintaining the falsity of
-- "addressSuitableForCollateral" (Nothing = False, Just = True).
-- From here, the composition operator discards the value inside the Maybe, and
-- so the next argument can only depend on the falsity of the Maybe (indeed, it
-- must). Thus the falsity of the properties is maintained (i.e. "asCollateral"
-- will accept/reject an UTxO correctly, so long as
-- "addressSuitableForCollateral" assesses an address correctly, which is tested
-- above). "asCollateral" will return the correct coin value so long as
-- "TokenBundle.toCoin" is working correctly (tested elsewhere).
--
-- I wish I knew how to formally prove things using category theory concepts
-- like monadic composition...
