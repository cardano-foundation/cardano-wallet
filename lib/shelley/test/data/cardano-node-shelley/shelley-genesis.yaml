# IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THIS FILE
#
# a) cardano-node does not parse 'yaml' but only 'json'. We use yaml as a nicer/simpler format
#    and convert it as json when generating the underlying configuration for the node.
#
# b) the `systemStart` is hard-coded here to please the parser but is replaced dynamically
#    by the same code generating the final node configuration for integration.
#
# c) initialFunds are defined as a list of singleton, and not as a key-value map like in the
#    json equivalent. The reason is to allow preserving the order of declaration when parsing
#    the file which is crucial for sequential discovery. Once again, when converting to JSON,
#    this is transformed in a proper map.
#
# See also: lib/shelley/src/Cardano/Wallet/Shelley/Launch.hs for details.
