## Overview

This package provides a notion of *delta types* via the `Delta` typeclass.

A *delta type* `da` for a *base type* `a` is a collection of values that each correspond to a change `a → a` of the base type. The following typeclass captures this correspondence:

    class Delta da where
        type Base da = a
        apply :: da → (a → a)

In the literature, this concept is also known as a *change action*, with relations to incremental computation and differential lambda calculus. See References.

For example, one delta type for `Set a` is given by

    data DeltaSet1 a = Insert a | Delete a
    
    instance Delta (DeltaSet1 a) where
        type Base (DeltaSet1 a) = Set a
        apply (Insert a) = Data.Set.insert a
        apply (Delete a) = Date.Set.delete a

In general, there may be multiple delta types associated with a single base type.

### Modules

* [Data.Delta](src/Data/Delta.hs)
    * Contains the `Delta` class. Each member type `da` represents
      a delta type for a base type `Base da`.
      A few basic delta encodings are implemented.
    * Contains the `Embedding` type which represents an embedding
      of one type and its delta type into another type.
      `Embedding` can be composed and form a `Semigroupoid`.
      (Abstractly, embeddings form a category, but for technical reasons,
      the `Embedding` type is currently not a member of the `Category` class
      — The types appearing in an `Embedding` are members of
      the `Delta` class, but the types in the `id` combinator are very general.
      This limitation could be removed in a future version
      by adding an additional constraint on the `inject` function.)
