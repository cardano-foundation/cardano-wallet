-- | AES is a subset of the family of block ciphers known as Rijndael.
-- That family includes no less than 15 variants, for three possible block
-- sizes (128, 192 and 256 bits).
-- Three are supported by cryptonite, AES128, AES192 and AES256 (used here).
-- There are five possible key sizes (128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 bits).
-- In case of cryptonite implementation we have the following constraints:
-- (AES128 - 16 bytes, AES192 - 24 bytes, AES 256 - 32 bytes).
-- AES, as standardized by NIST, includes only three variants, all with 128-bit
-- blocks,
-- and with keys of 128, 192 or 256 bits.
-- The same as adopted in cryptonite.
-- The block size of AES is always 128 bits, so a 256 bit IV is not possible
-- for most modes of operation. These are the reasons we require the secret key
-- to be 32 bytes and iv 16 bytes for AES256 used here.
-- Additionally, input length must be a multiple of block size, ie., 16 bytes.
-- In order to realize this PKCS#7 padding is available as an option.
-- This padding is preferred because it is unambiguous and widely used (for
-- example in OpenSSL).
-- One can always read the last byte and remove that number of padding bytes,
-- and then detect if the decryption was successful by checking that all of
-- the bytes removed have the same value.

-- | Apply PKCS#7 padding to payload and end up with a multiple of a block
-- size, i.e., 16 bytes, according to
-- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5652#section-6.3.
-- The padding value is the number of padding bytes.
-- If 1 byte of padding is required, the padding is "01".
-- If 2 bytes of padding, it's "02 02".
-- If no padding is required, an extra block of 0x10 bytes is added,
-- i.e., sixteen copies of 16, which is the blocksize.
-- This means that payload can only fit 15 bytes into a single block with
-- padding. A 16 byte payload requires 2 blocks with padding.
