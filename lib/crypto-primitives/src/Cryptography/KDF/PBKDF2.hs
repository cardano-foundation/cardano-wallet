-- | PBKDF2 key generation
-- The PBKDF2 key generation function turns a plain user password or passphrase
-- into a cryptographic key suitable for encrypting data.
-- This function adds computational work intentionally,
-- so that it becomes more difficult to find the password
-- through systematic and automated guessing.
-- As some encryption algorithms require both 'key' and 'iv' (for example, aes-256-cbc)
-- the function returns both. In case the encryption algorithm does not need it
-- like in case of elliptic encryption (for example, aes-256-ecb) one can take only 'key'
-- and omit 'iv'.
-- A number of pass iterations translates into slowness of the algorithm (and its security).
-- A salt is used to randomize the hashing and overall is advised to be used.

    -- the password shorter than 64-byte is padded with \NUL (0x00)
    -- meaning passwords p, p <> 'NUL', p <> 'NUL' <> 'NUL', ... are indifferentiable and
    -- result in the same (key,iv) for the rest arguments identical.
