# The security of cardano-wallet API

## Executive summary :
1. If cardano-wallet is used only with the trusted Daedalus app, then the API security is fine.
2. If cardano-wallet is used within current setup with trusted app other than Daedalus, then it is good idea to
        (a) enable logging to files with file-rotation support that can easily be enabled via configuration.
3. If cardano-wallet is used with app running in browser then we need additionally to point 2 :
        (a) set secure response headers to avoid security pitfalls
        (b) set properly CORS-related configuration
        (c) introduce rate-limiter with 429 Too Many Requests header
4. If cardano-wallet is to be served (publicly/privately) then a lot of stuff needs to be addressed (besides all in point 3):
       (a) make more restrictive usage of DB : add users with operation granting
       (b) All security mechanism embracing proper authentication/logging analytics/encryption

## OWASP risks

### OWASP risk : injection

Sqlite implementation of DBLayer depends on persistent or persistent-sqlite primitives. As an example, let's consider wallet creation. It is realized by initializeWallet which uses insert_ implemented in https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/blob/53fa7589db2cabe586d506fea12006b759b1ce79/persistent-sqlite/Database/Persist/Sqlite.hs#L218

Basically, inserting is realized by constructing the Text value :
```
INSERT INTO "wallet" ("id", "creation_time", "name", "passphrase_last_updated_at") VALUES(?,?,?,?)
```
The values are prepared here by the function :
```
mkWalletEntity :: W.WalletId -> W.WalletMetadata -> Wallet
mkWalletEntity wid meta = Wallet
     { walId = wid
     , walName = meta ^. #name . coerce
     , walCreationTime = meta ^. #creationTime
     , walPassphraseLastUpdatedAt =
         W.lastUpdatedAt <$> meta ^. #passphraseInfo
     }
```
So the one way we could realize SQL injection would be to construct test on integration test like that :
```
let payload = Json [json| {
    "name": "new wallet\",''); DROP TABLE \"wallet\"; --",
    "mnemonic_sentence": #{mnemonics},
    "passphrase": "12345678910"
    } |]
r <- request @ApiWallet ctx (Link.postWallet @'Shelley) Default payload
```
and that way forcing the command to look like
```
INSERT INTO "wallet" ("id", "creation_time", "name", "passphrase_last_updated_at") VALUES('id1',"time1","new wallet",''); DROP TABLE "wallet"; --"FALSE");
```
But, because persistent-sqlite uses https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/blob/53fa7589db2cabe586d506fea12006b759b1ce79/persistent-sqlite/Database/Persist/Sqlite.hs#L483 widepsreadly then we should expect rather than dropping the table this (and it is the result of the test) :
```
verify r
    [ expectResponseCode @IO HTTP.status201
    , expectFieldEqual walletName "new wallet\",''); DROP TABLE \"wallet\"; --"
```
Using escaping of any character is one of the methods to to prevent any inputs to have an effect.
Now because almost all DBLayer methods as implemented in Sqlite.hs use primitives that force text in VALUES then it is reasonably ok to assume we are immune from this kind of injection attack. The only place that uses rawExecute is https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet/DB/Sqlite.hs#L779
but deleteLoose that could affect the DB is used with two values only :
```
deleteLoose "tx_in"
deleteLoose "tx_out"
```
So it is secure too.

**Conclusion** : Sqlite impl of DBLayer is resistant from direct injection intrusion (so called First Order Attack) because of escape of any character measure adopted in persistent library in the methods we use throughout our code. The only use of raw execution does not allow to inject any text from input parameters, hence is immune from this kind of attacks.

If cardano-wallet API part will become part of other component that will be deployed publicly, it would be good to consider creating restrictive user as a consequence of principle of least authority (POLA) - ie., user/processes in the system will be given only those permissions needed to its job, no more, no less. So, if we identify that user does need to DROP/DELETE then we could add something like that upon DB creation:
```
CREATE USER restricted_api_user PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table1, table2 TO restricted_api_user;
```

### OWASP risk : Improper Assets Management

**Conclusion**: Each endpoint, its corresponding inputs and outputs is documented, and updated upon development in https://cardano-foundation.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/
There are no undocumented and bogus endpoints operative.

### OWASP risk : Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

1. Check what is logged for each API endpoint
API logging is realized in https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Network/Wai/Middleware/Logging.hs#L80
Basically in every API call we log : request id (every new api call incremented +1), method name and endpoint. Also for the corresponding call response is logged (the request id, http response code and the time it tooks from request to response. Eg.,
```
[cardano-wallet.api-server:Info:44] [2020-01-14 09:48:37.04 UTC] [RequestId 1] [GET] /v2/wallets/135bfb99b9f7a0c702bf8c658cc0d9b1a0d797a2
[cardano-wallet.api-server:Info:44] [2020-01-14 09:48:37.05 UTC] [RequestId 1] 200 OK in 0.009605239s
```
This setting follows from https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Network/Wai/Middleware/Logging.hs#L275-L295
Public and Info are set for integration testing and cardano-wallet-jormungandr - here we can set it via command line options: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/jormungandr/exe/cardano-wallet-jormungandr.hs#L360). Also, we do care that some values are never shown : https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet/Api/Server.hs#L351-L358
Which is fine and covers all values that need to be obfuscated.

Additionally, some actions taken in Cardano.Wallet also result in logging that reveals information present reflected in API calls (although as indirectly and at later time). In details, this modules outputs :

https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet.hs#L633-L635
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet.hs#L691-L701
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet.hs#L713-L723
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet.hs#L870-L876
https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet.hs#L903-L904
For example, when creating and logging checkpoint we have the following information :
```
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.08 UTC] 135bfb99: Applying blocks [1139663.1 ... 1139663.1]
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.08 UTC] 135bfb99: Creating checkpoint at a212a0d3-[1139663.1#1]
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.09 UTC] 135bfb99: new wallet",''); DROP TABLE "wallet"; --, created at 2020-01-14 09:48:36.84066258 UTC, not delegating
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.09 UTC] 135bfb99: syncProgress: restored
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.09 UTC] 135bfb99: discovered 0 new transaction(s)
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.09 UTC] 135bfb99: local tip: a212a0d3-[1139663.1#1]
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.09 UTC] 135bfb99: blocks: [a212a0d3-[1139663.1#1] âˆ…]
[cardano-wallet.wallet-engine:Info:48] [2020-01-14 09:48:39.09 UTC] 135bfb99: transactions: []
```
Hence, the name, creation date, delegation info of the wallet created earlier.

Logging in lib/jormungandr/exe/cardano-wallet-jormungandr.hs, lib/wallet/src/Cardano/Wallet/Network.hs and lib/cli/src/Cardano.Wallet.Application.CLI.hs does not contribute to revealing of API calls info at all.

**Conclusions** : The details of API logging is presented above. Sensitive information is concealed. Direct logging from API (as default it is Info severity level) is not giving very basic information about call method, endpoint, the response code, and time needed to realize it. Probably, it would be good to have Debug as a default - if we want to help other peoples and have maximum information possible without compromising their confidential info.

2. Check what happens when the instance is long lived when it comes to logs.

Logging is emitted to stdout and there is no way to change it now being the user of cardano-wallet. Daedalus, using cardano-wallet inside, realizes rotation based logging itself. It is set, user cannot control it. Moreover, it includes also logs from its layer. Some users, though, use cardano-wallet without Daedalus.

**Conclusions** : Logs land to stdout, which has its pros and cons (it can be lost when terminal is set and by definition is less persistent). It would be good to add option for rotation, and embrace possibilities of iohk-monitoring-framework : https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-monitoring-framework/blob/bea0e079fc32ed316ce352d17d14199a680e3f6c/iohk-monitoring/src/Cardano/BM/Data/Rotation.lhs#L29
Maybe it is even good to set this as default - users with problems could then immediately share logs with us.

### OWASP risk : Security Misconfiguration

1. Misconfigured HTTP headers
Even if the API is a standalone piece of software, we need to think how it will behave as part of an HTML application. And here, XSS attacks against web browser clients can be realized. In order to avoid it a number of measures can be taken:
a -  (**ok**). It is good to be strict in what API accepts. In our case Content-Type header is set application/json for all endpoints except submitting external tx, ie., /proxy/transactions where it is set to application/octet-stream. We check this in integration scenarios, eg. https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Test/Integration/Scenario/API/Wallets.hs#L785
b -  (**ok**). All outputs are well-formed using Aeson JSON library, no output forming by concatenating strings.
c -  (**ok**). Content-Type headers are added in API's responses.
d - . (**to be addressed**). Adding other standard security headers in API's responses :
```
("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block") - telling browser to block /ignore suspected XSS attacks
("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff") - prevent browser guessing Content-Type
("X-Frame-Options", "deny") - prevent API responses being loaded in a frame or iframe
("Cache-Control","private, max-age=0") - control whether browser/proxies can cache content in the response and how long for
("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; sandbox") - restricting where script can be loaded - so called CSP
```
e -  (**ok**). Do not specify server version in order to avoid attacks pertinent to version-known vulnerabilities. Due to nature of open source we cannot do anything about it - anyone can check what server we use.

2. Unnecessary HTTP methods
There are no unnecessary endpoints served. This is checked in integration tests, eg. https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/blob/master/lib/wallet/src/Test/Integration/Scenario/API/Wallets.hs#L840

3. CQRS not addressed - will need to be tackled when API is part of web browser api

### OWASP risk : Rate-limiter and others

Here we start with the following assumption :
`cardano-wallet API will be run locally, listening on localhost, for use by a trusted application (daedalus).`

If it is going to be part of public API/deployed in private/public cloud the following areas need to be addressed :
(a) obligatory use of HTTPS
Here, remember about adding response header HSTS, ie.,
```
("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000")
```
(b) multi-level use of rate-limiter (on reverse proxy, gateway, and also attached directly to API as will be covered below) BEFORE next security components
(c) authentication (as a measure against DoS attacks and an input for access control)
Here, huge number of options are available (starting from simple ones)
- basic http authentication
- using secure password storage (Scrypt, Argon2, Bcrypt, ...) - see recent recommendation : https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html (and here, usage of memory-hard hash functions)
- bearer auth scheme - OAuth2
(d) audit logging (so extend current logging by adding authorization logs). Consider using DB solution for logging (as a way to have in-house analytics on top of it or just try to use elasticsearch or summologic solutions directly on logs)
(e) access control - differentiate actions AFTER authorization (401 vs 403). Think about Access Control Lists (ACL) and privilege escalation.

Generally speaking the above security mechanisms (ie., security controls of rate-limiting, encryption, authentication and audit logging), when properly applied, can address STRIDE threat (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege).

Given the assumption, though, I think it would be beneficial to introduce rate-limiter solution to cardano-wallet and to have a solution that throttle number of calls possible to API (even trusted application can do it unintentionally). If this happens, then adequate response will be emitted.

If we are to use rate-limiter then we should probably try to use https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-middleware-throttle
and as a test we should use :
```
for i in {1..100}; do curl http://localhost:8090/v2/wallets --http1.1 ; done
```
and depending on number of request set in a given period for some of them we should end up with response header :
```
429 Too Many Requests
```
**Conclusions** : consider adding rate limiter as sketched above. If the assumption is not valid anymore (ie., local API with localhost listening talking with trusted app with colocation) then all security mechanisms enumerated above needs to be implemented in order to address STRIDE threat.
