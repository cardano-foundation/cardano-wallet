synopsis:           Explore feasability of light mode
description:
    This prototype explores whether we can implement a "light mode"
    for cardano-wallet which aims to make synchronisation faster by
    using a less trusted source for blockchain data.
    .
    Here, we explore the feasability of http://blockfrost.io as
    a data source. Specifically:
    .
    * Does the data source provide enough data so that we can implement all of 'NetworkLayer'?
    .
    * Does it suffice to change 'NetworkLayer' to use a 'BlockSummary'?
    .
    The "Light" module provides detailed answers to these questions.
    .
    The "Demo" module contains example code for running these answers.
