-- | Run a 'bracket' resource acquisition function around all the specs. The
-- bracket opens before the first test case and closes after the last test case.
--
-- It works by actually spawning a new thread responsible for the resource
-- acquisition, passing the resource along to the parent threads via a shared
-- MVar. Then, there's a bit of logic to synchronize both threads and make sure
-- that:
--
-- a) The 'Resource Owner' thread is terminated when the main thread is done
--    with the resource.
--
-- b) The 'Main Thread' only exists when the resource owner has released the
--    resource. Exiting the main thread before the 'Resource Owner' has
--    released the resource could left a hanging resource open. This is
--    particularly annoying when the resource is a running process!
