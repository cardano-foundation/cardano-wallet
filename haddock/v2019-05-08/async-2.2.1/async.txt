-- | Run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results
--   
--   This package provides a higher-level interface over threads, in which
--   an <tt>Async a</tt> is a concurrent thread that will eventually
--   deliver a value of type <tt>a</tt>. The package provides ways to
--   create <tt>Async</tt> computations, wait for their results, and cancel
--   them.
--   
--   Using <tt>Async</tt> is safer than using threads in two ways:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>When waiting for a thread to return a result, if the thread dies
--   with an exception then the caller must either re-throw the exception
--   (<a>wait</a>) or handle it (<a>waitCatch</a>); the exception cannot be
--   ignored.</li>
--   <li>The API makes it possible to build a tree of threads that are
--   automatically killed when their parent dies (see
--   <a>withAsync</a>).</li>
--   </ul>

@version 2.2.1


-- | This module provides a set of operations for running IO operations
--   asynchronously and waiting for their results. It is a thin layer over
--   the basic concurrency operations provided by
--   <a>Control.Concurrent</a>. The main additional functionality it
--   provides is the ability to wait for the return value of a thread, but
--   the interface also provides some additional safety and robustness over
--   using threads and <tt>MVar</tt> directly.
--   
--   The basic type is <tt><a>Async</a> a</tt>, which represents an
--   asynchronous <tt>IO</tt> action that will return a value of type
--   <tt>a</tt>, or die with an exception. An <tt>Async</tt> corresponds to
--   a thread, and its <a>ThreadId</a> can be obtained with
--   <a>asyncThreadId</a>, although that should rarely be necessary.
--   
--   For example, to fetch two web pages at the same time, we could do this
--   (assuming a suitable <tt>getURL</tt> function):
--   
--   <pre>
--   do a1 &lt;- async (getURL url1)
--      a2 &lt;- async (getURL url2)
--      page1 &lt;- wait a1
--      page2 &lt;- wait a2
--      ...
--   </pre>
--   
--   where <a>async</a> starts the operation in a separate thread, and
--   <a>wait</a> waits for and returns the result. If the operation throws
--   an exception, then that exception is re-thrown by <a>wait</a>. This is
--   one of the ways in which this library provides some additional safety:
--   it is harder to accidentally forget about exceptions thrown in child
--   threads.
--   
--   A slight improvement over the previous example is this:
--   
--   <pre>
--   withAsync (getURL url1) $ \a1 -&gt; do
--   withAsync (getURL url2) $ \a2 -&gt; do
--   page1 &lt;- wait a1
--   page2 &lt;- wait a2
--   ...
--   </pre>
--   
--   <a>withAsync</a> is like <a>async</a>, except that the <a>Async</a> is
--   automatically killed (using <a>uninterruptibleCancel</a>) if the
--   enclosing IO operation returns before it has completed. Consider the
--   case when the first <a>wait</a> throws an exception; then the second
--   <a>Async</a> will be automatically killed rather than being left to
--   run in the background, possibly indefinitely. This is the second way
--   that the library provides additional safety: using <a>withAsync</a>
--   means we can avoid accidentally leaving threads running. Furthermore,
--   <a>withAsync</a> allows a tree of threads to be built, such that
--   children are automatically killed if their parents die for any reason.
--   
--   The pattern of performing two IO actions concurrently and waiting for
--   their results is packaged up in a combinator <a>concurrently</a>, so
--   we can further shorten the above example to:
--   
--   <pre>
--   (page1, page2) &lt;- concurrently (getURL url1) (getURL url2)
--   ...
--   </pre>
--   
--   The <a>Functor</a> instance can be used to change the result of an
--   <a>Async</a>. For example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   ghci&gt; a &lt;- async (return 3)
--   ghci&gt; wait a
--   3
--   ghci&gt; wait (fmap (+1) a)
--   4
--   </pre>
module Control.Concurrent.Async

-- | An asynchronous action spawned by <a>async</a> or <a>withAsync</a>.
--   Asynchronous actions are executed in a separate thread, and operations
--   are provided for waiting for asynchronous actions to complete and
--   obtaining their results (see e.g. <a>wait</a>).
data Async a

-- | Spawn an asynchronous action in a separate thread.
async :: IO a -> IO (Async a)

-- | Like <a>async</a> but using <a>forkOS</a> internally.

asyncOn :: Int -> IO a -> IO (Async a)

-- | Like <a>async</a> but using <a>forkIOWithUnmask</a> internally. The
--   child thread is passed a function that can be used to unmask
--   asynchronous exceptions.
asyncWithUnmask :: ((forall b. IO b -> IO b) -> IO a) -> IO (Async a)

-- | Like <a>asyncOn</a> but using <a>forkOnWithUnmask</a> internally. The

asyncOnWithUnmask :: Int -> ((forall b. IO b -> IO b) -> IO a) -> IO (Async a)

-- | Spawn an asynchronous action in a separate thread, and pass its

--   
--   <pre>
--   withAsync action inner = mask $ \restore -&gt; do
--     a &lt;- async (restore action)
--     restore inner `finally` uninterruptibleCancel a
--   </pre>
--   
--   This is a useful variant of <a>async</a> that ensures an
--   <tt>Async</tt> is never left running unintentionally.
--   
--   Note: a reference to the child thread is kept alive until the call to
--   <a>withAsync</a> returns, so nesting many <a>withAsync</a> calls
--   requires linear memory.
withAsync :: IO a -> (Async a -> IO b) -> IO b

--   Note that <a>cancel</a> will not terminate until the thread the
--   <a>Async</a> refers to has terminated. This means that <a>cancel</a>
--   will block for as long said thread blocks when receiving an
--   asynchronous exception.
--   
--   For example, it could block if:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>It's executing a foreign call, and thus cannot receive the

--   <li>It's executing some cleanup handler after having received the

waitAny :: [Async a] -> IO (Async a, a)
