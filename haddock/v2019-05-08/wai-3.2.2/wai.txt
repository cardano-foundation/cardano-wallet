data Request
Request :: Method -> HttpVersion -> ByteString -> ByteString -> RequestHeaders -> Bool -> SockAddr -> [Text] -> Query -> IO ByteString -> Vault -> RequestBodyLength -> Maybe ByteString -> Maybe ByteString -> Maybe ByteString -> Maybe ByteString -> Request

-- | Request method such as GET.
[requestMethod] :: Request -> Method

-- | HTTP version such as 1.1.
[httpVersion] :: Request -> HttpVersion

-- | Extra path information sent by the client. The meaning varies slightly
--   depending on backend; in a standalone server setting, this is most
--   likely all information after the domain name. In a CGI application,
--   this would be the information following the path to the CGI executable
--   itself.
--   
--   Middlewares and routing tools should not modify this raw value, as it
--   may be used for such things as creating redirect destinations by
--   applications. Instead, if you are writing a middleware or routing
--   framework, modify the <tt>pathInfo</tt> instead. This is the approach
--   taken by systems like Yesod subsites.
--   
--   <i>Note</i>: At the time of writing this documentation, there is at
--   least one system (<tt>Network.Wai.UrlMap</tt> from <tt>wai-extra</tt>)
--   that does not follow the above recommendation. Therefore, it is

-- | If no query string was specified, this should be empty. This value

[rawQueryString] :: Request -> ByteString

-- | A list of headers (a pair of key and value) in an HTTP request.
[requestHeaders] :: Request -> RequestHeaders

-- | Was this request made over an SSL connection?
--   
--   Note that this value will <i>not</i> tell you if the client originally
--   made this request over SSL, but rather whether the current connection
--   is SSL. The distinction lies with reverse proxies. In many cases, the
--   client will connect to a load balancer over SSL, but connect to the
--   WAI handler without SSL. In such a case, <a>isSecure</a> will be
--   <a>False</a>, but from a user perspective, there is a secure
--   connection.

-- | This module defines a generic web application interface. It is a
--   common protocol between web servers and web applications.
--   
--   The overriding design principles here are performance and generality.
--   To address performance, this library uses a streaming interface for
--   request and response bodies, paired with bytestring's <a>Builder</a>
--   type. The advantages of a streaming API over lazy IO have been debated
--   elsewhere and so will not be addressed here. However, helper functions
--   like <a>responseLBS</a> allow you to continue using lazy IO if you so
--   desire.
--   
--   Generality is achieved by removing many variables commonly found in
--   similar projects that are not universal to all servers. The goal is
--   that the <a>Request</a> object contains only data which is meaningful
--   in all circumstances.
--   
--   Please remember when using this package that, while your application
--   may compile without a hitch against many different servers, there are
--   other considerations to be taken when moving to a new backend. For
--   example, if you transfer from a CGI application to a FastCGI one, you
--   might suddenly find you have a memory leak. Conversely, a FastCGI
--   application would be well served to preload all templates from disk
--   when first starting; this would kill the performance of a CGI
--   application.
--   
--   This package purposely provides very little functionality. You can
--   find various middlewares, backends and utilities on Hackage. Some of
--   the most commonly used include:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><i>warp</i> <a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp</a></li>
--   <li><i>wai-extra</i>
--   <a>http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-extra</a></li>
--   <li><i>wai-test</i>

--   </ul>
module Network.Wai

-- | The WAI application.
--   
--   Note that, since WAI 3.0, this type is structured in continuation
--   passing style to allow for proper safe resource handling. This was
--   handled in the past via other means (e.g., <tt>ResourceT</tt>). As a
--   demonstration:
--   
--   <pre>
--   app :: Application
--   app req respond = bracket_
--       (putStrLn "Allocating scarce resource")
--       (putStrLn "Cleaning up")
--       (respond $ responseLBS status200 [] "Hello World")
--   </pre>
type Application = Request -> (Response -> IO ResponseReceived) -> IO ResponseReceived

-- | Middleware is a component that sits between the server and
--   application. It can do such tasks as GZIP encoding or response
--   caching. What follows is the general definition of middleware, though
--   a middleware author should feel free to modify this.
--   
--   As an example of an alternate type for middleware, suppose you write a
--   function to load up session information. The session information is
--   simply a string map &lt;math&gt;. A logical type signature for this
--   middleware might be:
--   
--   <pre>
--   loadSession :: ([(String, String)] -&gt; Application) -&gt; Application
--   </pre>
--   
--   Here, instead of taking a standard <a>Application</a> as its first
--   argument, the middleware takes a function which consumes the session
--   information as well.

-- | Creating <a>Response</a> from a file.
responseFile :: Status -> ResponseHeaders -> FilePath -> Maybe FilePart -> Response

-- | Creating <a>Response</a> from <a>Builder</a>.
--   
--   Some questions and answers about the usage of <a>Builder</a> here:
--   
--   Q1. Shouldn't it be at the user's discretion to use Builders
--   internally and then create a stream of ByteStrings?
--   
--   A1. That would be less efficient, as we wouldn't get cheap
--   concatenation with the response headers.
--   
--   Q2. Isn't it really inefficient to convert from ByteString to Builder,
--   and then right back to ByteString?
--   
--   A2. No. If the ByteStrings are small, then they will be copied into a
--   larger buffer, which should be a performance gain overall (less system
--   calls). If they are already large, then an insert operation is used to
--   avoid copying.
--   
--   Q3. Doesn't this prevent us from creating comet-style servers, since
--   data will be cached?
--   
--   A3. You can force a Builder to output a ByteString before it is an
--   optimal size by sending a flush command.
responseBuilder :: Status -> ResponseHeaders -> Builder -> Response

-- | Creating <a>Response</a> from <a>ByteString</a>. This is a wrapper for
--   <a>responseBuilder</a>.
responseLBS :: Status -> ResponseHeaders -> ByteString -> Response

-- | Creating <a>Response</a> from a stream of values.
--   
--   In order to allocate resources in an exception-safe manner, you can
--   use the <tt>bracket</tt> pattern outside of the call to
--   <tt>responseStream</tt>. As a trivial example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   app :: Application
--   app req respond = bracket_
--       (putStrLn "Allocating scarce resource")
--       (putStrLn "Cleaning up")
--       $ respond $ responseStream status200 [] $ \write flush -&gt; do
--           write $ byteString "Hello\n"
--           flush
--           write $ byteString "World\n"
--   </pre>
--   
--   Note that in some cases you can use <tt>bracket</tt> from inside
--   <tt>responseStream</tt> as well. However, placing the call on the
--   outside allows your status value and response headers to depend on the
--   scarce resource.
--   
--   Since 3.0.0
responseStream :: Status -> ResponseHeaders -> StreamingBody -> Response

-- | Create a response for a raw application. This is useful for "upgrade"
--   situations such as WebSockets, where an application requests for the

--   
--   This function requires a backup response to be provided, for the case
--   where the handler in question does not support such upgrading (e.g.,
--   CGI apps).
--   
--   In the event that you read from the request body before returning a
