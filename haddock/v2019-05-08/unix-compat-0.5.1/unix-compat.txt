-- | Portable POSIX-compatibility layer.
--   
--   This package provides portable implementations of parts of the unix
--   package. This package re-exports the unix package when available. When
--   it isn't available, portable implementations are used.
@package unix-compat
@version 0.5.1


-- | This module makes the operations exported by
--   <tt>System.Posix.Files</tt> available on all platforms. On POSIX
--   systems it re-exports operations from <tt>System.Posix.Files</tt>. On
--   other platforms it emulates the operations as far as possible.
--   
--   /NOTE: the portable implementations are not well tested, in some cases
--   functions are only stubs./
module System.PosixCompat.Files

-- | Combines the two file modes into one that contains modes that appear
--   in either.
unionFileModes :: FileMode -> FileMode -> FileMode

-- | Owner, group and others have read, write and execute permission.
accessModes :: FileMode

-- | <tt>setFileMode path mode</tt> changes permission of the file given by
--   <tt>path</tt> to <tt>mode</tt>. This operation may fail with
--   <a>throwErrnoPathIfMinus1_</a> if <tt>path</tt> doesn't exist or if
--   the effective user ID of the current process is not that of the file's
--   owner.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>chmod</tt>.
setFileMode :: FilePath -> FileMode -> IO ()

-- | <tt>setFdMode fd mode</tt> acts like <tt>setFileMode</tt> but uses a

--   
--   Note: calls <tt>fchmod</tt>.
setFdMode :: Fd -> FileMode -> IO ()

-- | <tt>setFileCreationMask mode</tt> sets the file mode creation mask to

--   returned.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>umask</tt>.
setFileCreationMask :: FileMode -> IO FileMode

-- | <tt>fileAccess name read write exec</tt> checks if the file (or other

--   
--   Note: calls <tt>access</tt>.
fileAccess :: FilePath -> Bool -> Bool -> Bool -> IO Bool

-- | Checks for the existence of the file.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>access</tt>.
fileExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool

-- | POSIX defines operations to get information, such as owner,

--   represented by the <a>FileStatus</a> type.
--   
--   Note: see <tt>chmod</tt>.
data FileStatus

-- | <tt>getFileStatus path</tt> calls gets the <tt>FileStatus</tt>
--   information (user ID, size, access times, etc.) for the file

--   
--   Note: calls <tt>fstat</tt>.
getFdStatus :: Fd -> IO FileStatus

-- | Acts as <a>getFileStatus</a> except when the <a>FilePath</a> refers to
--   a symbolic link. In that case the <tt>FileStatus</tt> information of
--   the symbolic link itself is returned instead of that of the file it
--   points to.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>lstat</tt>.

isSocket :: FileStatus -> Bool

-- | <tt>createNamedPipe fifo mode</tt> creates a new named pipe,
--   <tt>fifo</tt>, with permissions based on <tt>mode</tt>. May fail with
--   <a>throwErrnoPathIfMinus1_</a> if a file named <tt>name</tt> already
--   exists or if the effective user ID of the current process doesn't have
--   permission to create the pipe.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>mkfifo</tt>.
createNamedPipe :: FilePath -> FileMode -> IO ()

-- | <tt>createDevice path mode dev</tt> creates either a regular or a
--   special file depending on the value of <tt>mode</tt> (and
--   <tt>dev</tt>). <tt>mode</tt> will normally be either
--   <a>blockSpecialMode</a> or <a>characterSpecialMode</a>. May fail with
--   <a>throwErrnoPathIfMinus1_</a> if a file named <tt>name</tt> already
--   exists or if the effective user ID of the current process doesn't have
--   permission to create the file.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>mknod</tt>.
createDevice :: FilePath -> FileMode -> DeviceID -> IO ()

-- | <tt>createLink old new</tt> creates a new path, <tt>new</tt>, linked
--   to an existing file, <tt>old</tt>.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>link</tt>.
createLink :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt>removeLink path</tt> removes the link named <tt>path</tt>.

--   link had been substituted into the path being followed to find a file
--   or directory.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>symlink</tt>.
createSymbolicLink :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

rename :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

-- | <tt>setOwnerAndGroup path uid gid</tt> changes the owner and group of
--   <tt>path</tt> to <tt>uid</tt> and <tt>gid</tt>, respectively.
--   
--   If <tt>uid</tt> or <tt>gid</tt> is specified as -1, then that ID is
--   not changed.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>chown</tt>.
setOwnerAndGroup :: FilePath -> UserID -> GroupID -> IO ()

-- | Acts as <tt>setOwnerAndGroup</tt> but uses a file descriptor instead
--   of a <a>FilePath</a>.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>fchown</tt>.
setFdOwnerAndGroup :: Fd -> UserID -> GroupID -> IO ()

-- | Acts as <a>setOwnerAndGroup</a> but does not follow symlinks (and thus
--   changes permissions on the link itself).
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>lchown</tt>.
setSymbolicLinkOwnerAndGroup :: FilePath -> UserID -> GroupID -> IO ()

-- | <tt>setFileTimes path atime mtime</tt> sets the access and
--   modification times associated with file <tt>path</tt> to

--   
--   Note: calls <tt>utime</tt>.
setFileTimes :: FilePath -> EpochTime -> EpochTime -> IO ()

-- | <tt>touchFile path</tt> sets the access and modification times
--   associated with file <tt>path</tt> to the current time.
--   
--   Note: calls <tt>utime</tt>.

-- | <tt>getPathVar var path</tt> obtains the dynamic value of the

-- | <tt>getFdPathVar var fd</tt> obtains the dynamic value of the

module System.PosixCompat.Temp

-- | Make a unique filename and open it for reading/writing. The returned

--   which is padded with 6 random characters. The argument is the desired
--   prefix of the filepath of the temporary file to be created.
--   
--   If you aren't using GHC or Hugs then this function simply wraps mktemp

-- | Sleep for the specified duration (in seconds). Returns the time

--   <i>GHC Note</i>: <a>threadDelay</a> is a better choice. Since GHC uses
