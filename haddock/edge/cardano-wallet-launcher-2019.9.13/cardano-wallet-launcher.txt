@package cardano-wallet-launcher
@version 2019.9.13


-- | This module contains a mechanism for launching external processes
--   together, and provides the functionality needed to kill them all if
--   one goes down. (would be achieved using <tt>monitor</tt> and
--   <tt>kill</tt> in combination)
module Cardano.Launcher

-- | Represent a command to execute. Args are provided as a list where
--   options are expected to be prefixed with `--` or <a>-</a>. For
--   example:
--   
--   <pre>
--   Command "cardano-wallet"
--       [ "server"
--       , "--port", "8080"
--       , "--network", "mainnet"
--       ] (return ())
--       Inherit
--   </pre>
data Command
Command :: String -> [String] -> IO () -> StdStream -> Command
[cmdName] :: Command -> String
[cmdArgs] :: Command -> [String]

-- | An extra action to run _before_ the command
[cmdSetup] :: Command -> IO ()

-- | What to do with stdout &amp; stderr
[cmdOutput] :: Command -> StdStream
data StdStream

-- | Inherit Handle from parent
Inherit :: StdStream

-- | Use the supplied Handle
UseHandle :: Handle -> StdStream

-- | Create a new pipe. The returned <tt>Handle</tt> will use the default
--   encoding and newline translation mode (just like <tt>Handle</tt>s
--   created by <tt>openFile</tt>).
CreatePipe :: StdStream

-- | Close the stream's file descriptor without passing a Handle. On POSIX
--   systems this may lead to strange behavior in the child process because
--   attempting to read or write after the file has been closed throws an
--   error. This should only be used with child processes that don't use
--   the file descriptor at all. If you wish to ignore the child process's
--   output you should either create a pipe and drain it manually or pass a
--   <tt>Handle</tt> that writes to <tt>/dev/null</tt>.
NoStream :: StdStream

-- | ProcessHasExited is used by a monitoring thread to signal that the
--   process has exited.
data ProcessHasExited
ProcessHasExited :: String -> ExitCode -> ProcessHasExited

-- | Run a bunch of command in separate processes. Note that, this
--   operation is blocking and will throw when one of the given commands
--   terminates. Commands are therefore expected to be daemon or
--   long-running services.
launch :: [Command] -> IO ProcessHasExited

-- | Convert any SIGTERM received to SIGINT, for which the runtime system
--   has handlers that will correctly clean up sub-processes.
